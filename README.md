# Volvo 940 (and probably others) Yazaki Instrument Cluster Electrolytic Capacitors

Capacitors in speedometer and tachometer seem to be most leak-prone. A visual inspection might be a good idea after 20 to 30 years, even if there is no strange needle movement yet. Capacitors in fuel gauge, clock and dimmer circuit are just listed for completeness sake. There is most likely no need to replace those right away.

The following listing contains electrical properties, original manufacturer and size of the capacitors found in early 90s instrument clusters. These values might differ from later models (probably starting with MY 95). Capacitors in Yazaki instrument clusters in Volvo 960 and some 760 are probably very very similar.

## Tachometer
